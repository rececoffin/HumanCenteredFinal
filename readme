This program requires a map of the designated area to be already built and saved on the machine
running this code!!

This program also requires that the "find_object_2d" library be installed

After a map has been created, modify the "run.sh" file to point to the location of the map. then
execute the "run.sh" file.

Modify the "patrol.py" file to set the coordinates for where you would like the robot to go.
After entering the desired coordinates, safe the file and run it using the commans "python navigate.py"
The robot should then automatically drive to the desired location, and then back to it's starting
point.
